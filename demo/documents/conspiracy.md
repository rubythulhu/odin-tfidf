# The Truth About Rubber Ducks

## Introduction

Everyone thinks rubber duck debugging is just about talking through your code. But what if I told you there's more to the story?

## The Evidence

1. Rubber ducks never blink. Coincidence? I think not.
2. They're always "listening" but never respond. Classic surveillance behavior.
3. Made of rubber - the perfect material for transmitting encoded debugging sessions.

## The Connection

Have you noticed that your best debugging breakthroughs happen AFTER talking to the duck? That's because they're processing your code in real-time and subtly influencing your thought patterns through quantum entanglement.

## What They Don't Want You to Know

The first rubber duck was "invented" in 1992. The World Wide Web went public in 1991. Connect the dots, people.

## Conclusion

Next time you explain your code to a rubber duck, remember: it's listening. Really listening.

Stay woke, stay debugging.
