# Live Commentary: The Great Code Review

**MINUTE 0:** And we're underway! Jenkins has just opened the pull request. It's a big one, folks - 47 files changed, 2,847 additions, 3 deletions.

**MINUTE 5:** First comment from Rodriguez: "Why?" A classic opening move.

**MINUTE 12:** Jenkins responds with "This was in the requirements." Rodriguez counters with a link to the requirements. Jenkins has gone quiet.

**MINUTE 23:** Here comes Peterson from the sidelines! "Did we consider using a library for this?" Oh, devastating. Jenkins clearly did not consider that.

**MINUTE 35:** Multiple comments now about code style. The linter is being mentioned. Tensions are high.

**MINUTE 47:** Jenkins has force-pushed. All previous comments are now outdated. Bold strategy.

**MINUTE 52:** New comment from Singh: "Looks good to me but I'm not approving until tests are added." Fair play.

**MINUTE 68:** Tests added. They're all passing. Wait - the build is failing. It's a linting issue. The crowd goes wild.

**MINUTE 73:** Linting fixed. Build is green. Three approvals. We're in the final stretch!

**MINUTE 75:** WAIT! Here comes the CTO with "One small suggestion" - it's a complete architectural rewrite. STUNNING.

**MINUTE 90+:** Jenkins has marked the PR as draft. This match is going into extra time.

**FINAL:** No merge today. We'll see you all tomorrow for the rematch.

What a game, folks. What a game.
