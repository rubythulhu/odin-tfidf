# How to Center a Div: A Novel

## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

In the beginning, there was a div. And the div was not centered.

## Chapter 2: The Ancient Texts

First, we consulted the sacred scrolls (CSS documentation). They spoke of many methods:

### Method 1: Flexbox
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Method 2: Grid
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Method 3: The Old Ways
```css
.div {
  margin: 0 auto;
  /* pray to the CSS gods */
}
```

## Chapter 3: It's Still Not Centered

Sometimes the div is centered horizontally but not vertically. Sometimes it's centered vertically but not horizontally. Sometimes it's centered in the viewport but not the container. Sometimes it's centered in a different dimension that we cannot perceive.

## Chapter 4: Acceptance

The div was centered within us all along.

## Epilogue

Just use Flexbox. Or Grid. Or ask Stack Overflow. We're all lost here together.

**Status**: Div may or may not be centered. Schrödinger's div.
