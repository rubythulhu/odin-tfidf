# Deep Thoughts on Software Development

Why do we call it a "bug" when the code does exactly what we told it to do, just not what we wanted it to do?

Is the computer really wrong, or are we simply poor communicators?

If a program compiles in the forest and no one is around to run it, does it still have memory leaks?

These are the questions that keep me up at night. Well, that and the fact that I drank coffee at 8pm.

## On Documentation

The best documentation is the code itself, said the developer who left the company three years ago and now no one knows what anything does.

## On Testing

In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. This is why we write tests. Or at least feel guilty about not writing tests.

## Conclusion

In the end, we're all just trying to make the computer do things. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Such is life.
