# A Comprehensive Study on the Correlation Between Coffee Consumption and Code Quality

## Abstract

This groundbreaking research examines the relationship between caffeinated beverage intake and the quality of software produced by developers. Using a sample size of myself over the past week, we have discovered statistically significant findings (p < 0.05 or whatever makes this sound legitimate).

## Introduction

Coffee has long been considered the lifeblood of software development. However, few studies have rigorously examined its effects on code quality, primarily because we were too busy drinking coffee to conduct such studies.

## Methodology

Participants (n=1) were observed in their natural habitat (a home office) over a period of 7 days. Coffee consumption was measured in cups, while code quality was measured using the highly scientific metric of "does it work?"

### Variables
- **Independent Variable**: Coffee consumption (cups per day)
- **Dependent Variable**: Code quality (bugs per line)
- **Control Variable**: Existential dread (constant)

## Results

Our findings indicate a strong positive correlation between coffee consumption and code quality up to approximately 4 cups per day. After this threshold, code quality remains high but commit messages become increasingly philosophical.

### Sample Commit Messages by Coffee Level
- 0 cups: "fix bug"
- 2 cups: "Fix authentication edge case in user validation"
- 4 cups: "Refactor authentication module for better separation of concerns"
- 6 cups: "we are all just functions in the grand program of existence; also fixed auth"

## Discussion

The data clearly shows that coffee is essential for software development. However, the threshold effect suggests that there is such a thing as too much coffee, even if we choose to ignore this finding in practice.

### Limitations
- Small sample size
- Researcher bias (I really like coffee)
- Inability to distinguish between correlation and causation
- No decaf control group (why would we do that to ourselves)

## Conclusion

Coffee good. Code good. Coffee plus code very good. More research needed, but first, more coffee.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my coffee maker for its unwavering support throughout this study.
