# DEBUGGER: A Thriller

**FADE IN:**

INT. DARK OFFICE - NIGHT

Our hero, DAVE (30s, hasn't seen sunlight in weeks), hunches over a keyboard. The clock reads 3:47 AM.

DAVE
(muttering)
It has to be here. The bug has to be here.

He scrolls through thousands of lines of legacy code. His coffee mug is empty. It's been empty for hours.

Suddenly, he sees it. Line 3,847. A semicolon. Where there should be a colon.

DAVE
(whispers)
No...

He fixes it. Hits compile. The progress bar moves slowly. Too slowly.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

Dave leans back. A single tear rolls down his cheek.

DAVE
I need a new job.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END**

(This film was nominated for nothing but it's how we all feel)
