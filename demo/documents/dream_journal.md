# Dream Journal Entry

**Date**: Last night

**Dream**: I was in production. The code was deploying but something was wrong. All my variables were undefined. I tried to console.log but nothing appeared. The logs were empty. Silent.

People were watching me. Users. Millions of them. All experiencing errors. The error count kept rising. 1,000. 10,000. 100,000.

I tried to rollback but the git history was gone. Every commit just said "fix stuff" with no description. I tried to SSH into the server but I couldn't remember the password. I tried "password123" - it didn't work.

My IDE turned into Microsoft Word. The code became Comic Sans. Stack Overflow returned 404.

Then I woke up. My laptop was still compiling. The build failed. The nightmare continues.

**Interpretation**: Need therapy. And better commit messages.
