# Ode to Stack Overflow

Oh Stack Overflow, my digital friend,
On you I perpetually depend,
When bugs arise and errors bloom,
You light the way through code-filled gloom.

Though marked as duplicate, still I search,
Through answers old as an ancient church,
From two-thousand-ten they still remain,
Using jQuery and bringing pain.

The downvotes come without a word,
My question deemed completely absurd,
"Unclear," they say, "Too broad," they claim,
Yet somehow I'm the one to blame.

But when at last I find the one,
The answer that makes my code run,
With zero votes and posted late,
I click that checkmark, sealed by fate.

So here's to you, SO divine,
Debugger of this code of mine,
Though toxic sometimes, still you're there,
My constant friend in dark despair.
