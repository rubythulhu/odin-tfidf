# Travel Guide: Stack Overflow

## Getting There
Press F1, or just google your error message. You'll end up here eventually.

## What to See
- Questions marked as duplicate (the main attraction)
- Answers from 2011 that no longer work
- Passive aggressive comments about your code style
- That one answer that's perfect but has 0 upvotes

## Local Customs
- Always try to solve it yourself first (but not really)
- Mark answers as accepted even if you just gave up
- Never admit you didn't understand the solution

## Dining
There is no food here. You will survive on coffee and desperation.

## Tips
- Best visited at 2am when deadlines loom
- Bring your ability to read between condescending lines
- Remember: someone else has definitely had this exact problem before

**Rating: 10/10** - Would panic-search again
