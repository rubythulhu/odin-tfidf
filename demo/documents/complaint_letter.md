# Formal Complaint

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally complain about whoever invented CSS.

Specifically, I would like to raise the following issues:

1. **Box model confusion**: Why are there two box models? Why must I remember which one is being used?

2. **Specificity**: The specificity calculation is more complex than my tax return.

3. **Vertical centering**: It is the year 2024. This should not still be a problem.

4. **Browser compatibility**: Why does my perfectly good CSS work in every browser except the one the client uses?

5. **Z-index**: I set it to 9999. Then to 99999. Then to 999999. Nothing makes sense anymore.

I await your response, though I know it will just be "use Flexbox" or "have you tried Grid?"

Sincerely,
A Frustrated Developer

P.S. While you're at it, can someone explain why `justify-content` and `align-items` switch meanings when you change `flex-direction`? Why must you hurt me this way?
