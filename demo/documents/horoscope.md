# Developer Horoscopes

## Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 19)
Your aggressive approach to debugging will pay off today. That said, maybe don't force-push to main.

## Taurus (Apr 20 - May 20)
Your stubbornness about not using that new framework will be vindicated when it's deprecated next month.

## Gemini (May 21 - Jun 20)
You'll switch between tabs so much today that even you won't know what you were working on.

## Cancer (Jun 21 - Jul 22)
Your emotional attachment to that legacy code is understandable, but it's time to let go. It's been 6 years.

## Leo (Jul 23 - Aug 22)
Everyone will notice your brilliant solution today. Mostly because you'll tell them. Multiple times.

## Virgo (Aug 23 - Sep 22)
Your attention to detail will catch a critical bug. Your teammates will ignore your fix until production breaks.

## Libra (Sep 23 - Oct 22)
You'll spend all day trying to decide between two equally valid approaches. The deadline will decide for you.

## Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
Your suspicions about that code smell were correct. Time to investigate. Bring coffee.

## Sagittarius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)
Your adventurous refactoring will break something unexpected. But hey, you learned something!

## Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)
Your methodical approach will solve today's problem efficiently. No one will appreciate it, but you'll know.

## Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)
Your unconventional solution will horrify senior developers but it'll work perfectly. Ship it.

## Pisces (Feb 19 - Mar 20)
You'll drift between tasks today, finishing none but somehow fixing three bugs accidentally.
