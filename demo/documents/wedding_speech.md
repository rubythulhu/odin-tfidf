# Best Man Speech (Developer Edition)

Good evening everyone. For those who don't know me, I'm Marcus, Tom's college roommate and fellow developer.

I've known Tom for 15 years. We learned to code together, debugged together, and once spent 18 hours trying to find a missing semicolon together. That's true friendship.

When Tom told me he met someone special, I knew it was serious because he actually closed his laptop during our video call. Sarah, you're literally the only person who has ever achieved this.

Tom and Sarah are a lot like a well-matched tech stack. Tom is the backend - reliable, handles all the complex logic, occasionally crashes at 3am. Sarah is the frontend - beautiful, user-friendly, makes everything look easy even when it's not.

Together they form a perfect API. They communicate clearly, handle errors gracefully, and have excellent uptime.

Some people say relationships are hard work. But as Tom knows, the best code often requires refactoring, debugging, and the occasional complete rewrite. But when you find the right person, it just... compiles.

So please raise your glasses to Tom and Sarah. May your marriage have zero downtime, infinite scalability, and only backwards-compatible changes.

To the happy couple!

(Tom, this is going in your code review later)
