# Product Review: Mechanical Keyboard

**Rating: 5/5 stars**

This keyboard is great. My coworkers hate it. The clicking noise asserts dominance in the open office.

Pros:
- Satisfying clicks
- Makes me feel like a hacker in movies
- Doubles as a percussion instrument

Cons:
- Cannot use during meetings
- Cat is startled by typing
- Now all other keyboards feel wrong

Would recommend to anyone who doesn't have roommates or values workplace harmony.
