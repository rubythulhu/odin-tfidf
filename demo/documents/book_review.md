# Book Review: "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin

**Rating**: 5/5 stars (guilt-induced)

This book will make you feel terrible about every line of code you've ever written. Which is exactly what you need.

Uncle Bob delivers harsh truths wrapped in reasonable arguments. Functions should be small. Names should be meaningful. Comments are a code smell. Everything I've ever done is wrong.

After reading this book, I went back to my codebase and wept. Then I refactored. Then I refactored the refactoring. It's been three months. I haven't shipped anything. But boy is it clean.

**Pros**:
- Genuinely good advice
- Clear examples
- Will make you a better developer
- Great for passive-aggressively leaving on coworkers' desks

**Cons**:
- Now I can't look at legacy code without having a small crisis
- Productivity initially drops to zero
- You become insufferable at code reviews

**Would recommend to**: Everyone who writes code
**Would not recommend to**: People with deadlines

Overall: Read it. Suffer through it. Become better for it. Then spend the rest of your career trying to convince others to follow principles you yourself sometimes ignore when the deadline is Friday.
