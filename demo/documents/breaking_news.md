# BREAKING: Local Developer's Code Works on First Try

**SILICON VALLEY** - In an unprecedented turn of events, local software developer Janet Chen reported that her code compiled and ran successfully on the first attempt, sending shockwaves through the development community.

"I don't know what happened," said Chen, still visibly shaken. "I wrote the function, ran it, and it just... worked. No errors. No warnings. Nothing."

Colleagues report that Chen has been staring at her monitor in silence for the past 20 minutes, afraid to touch anything.

"This is highly unusual," says Dr. Richard Martinez, a professor of software engineering at Stanford. "In my 30 years in this field, I've seen this happen maybe twice. We're monitoring the situation closely."

At press time, Chen had commented out all her code and was rewriting it from scratch because "something must be wrong."

More on this story as it develops.
